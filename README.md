PyCitySchool Analysis using Pandas

To assess the trends in school performance within the Local Government Area (LGA), key metrics such as school count, total student, budget allocation, and academic achievement in math and reading were analysed to understand educational outcomes and resource allocation. A detailed analysis was conducted using a DataFrame to identify top and bottom performing schools based on overall passing rates. Additionally, performance across different grade levels and factors like school size, type, and spending per student were examined to uncover trends.

Based on the analysis conducted below are few key findings.

•	The average maths and reading scores across different year levels were found to be relatively consistent across schools within the LGA. 

•	According to LGA summary, the overall passing percentage of 72% is notably lower than the individual passing percentages for math (86%) and reading (84%). This discrepancy could indicate that not all students who passed math also passed reading, and vice versa, contributing to a lower overall passing rate.

•	According to the bottom-performing five schools sorted by % overall passing, the majority were identified as government schools, despite having a higher per-student budget allocation. One exception was found in an independent school with a lower budget allocation.

•	Schools with smaller student populations tended to exhibit higher overall passing percentages in math and reading compared to larger schools. This trend highlights the potential benefits of smaller class sizes and more personalized educational experiences in fostering student success.

•	Independent schools showed slightly higher overall passing percentages than government schools. This suggests that factors such as governance structure, curriculum flexibility, or community support may contribute to the differences in academic performance observed between these school types.

•	In conclusion, the analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing academic performance, overall passing rates, and the impact of school characteristics within the LGA. 

The Jupyter notebook that we created for the analysis and the CSV files containing the folder called “Resources' folder” are in  PyCitySchool folder. Used Xpert learning assistant and ChatGTP to understand and debug codes when required.
