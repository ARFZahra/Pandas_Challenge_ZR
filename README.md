PyCitySchool Analysis using Pandas

To assess the trends in school performance within the Local Government Area (LGA), key metrics such as school count, total student, budget allocation, and academic achievement in maths and reading were analysed. Here, a detailed analysis was conducted using a DataFrame to identify top and bottom performing schools based on overall passing rates, performance across different grade levels and factors like school size, type, and spending per student to uncover trends.

Based on the analysis conducted below are few key findings.
•	According to LGA summary, the overall passing percentage of 72% is notably lower than the individual passing percentages for math (86%) and reading (84%). This discrepancy could indicate that not all students who passed math also passed reading, and vice versa, contributing to a lower overall passing rate.

•	Interestingly, the overall passing percentage among the top five schools did not show significant variation based on school type, size, or budget per school.

•	According to the bottom-performing five schools sorted by % overall passing, the majority were identified as government schools, despite having a higher per-student budget allocation. One exception was found in an independent school with a lower budget allocation.

•	The average maths and reading scores across different year levels were found to be relatively consistent across schools within the LGA. 

•	Schools with smaller student populations tended to exhibit higher overall passing percentages in math and reading compared to larger schools. This trend highlights the potential benefits of smaller class sizes and more personalized educational experiences in fostering student success.

•	Schools with a spending range of $630 or less per student demonstrated better academic performance compared to other spending categories.

•	Independent schools showed slightly higher overall passing percentages than government schools. This suggests that factors such as governance structure, curriculum flexibility, or community support may contribute to the differences in academic performance observed between these school types.

In brief, the analysis provides valuable insights into the factors influencing academic performance, overall passing rates, and the impact of school characteristics within the LGA. 

The Jupyter notebook created for the analysis, along with the CSV files located in the 'Resources' folder, are in the PyCitySchool folder. I utilized Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT to understand and debug codes when necessary
